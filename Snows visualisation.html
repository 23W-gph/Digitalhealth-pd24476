          On 31 August 1854, after several other outbreaks had occurred elsewhere in the city, a major outbreak of cholera occurred in Soho.Over the next three days, 127 people on or near Broad Street died. During the next week, three quarters of the residents had fled the area. By 10 September, 500 people had died and the mortality rate was 12.8 per cent in some parts of the city. By the end of the outbreak, 616 people had died

      <h2>Proving the theory</h2>
          <p>
               <ol>Snow knocked on doors and interviewed families with cholera. What united all the cases? They got their water at this Broad Street pump in the Soho neighborhood.</ol>

                     <li>At 4, Bermondsey Wall, on 23rd July, the daughter of a bookseller, aged 4 years, cholera 9 hours – Thames water, by dipping a pail in the water</li>
                     <li>At Falcon Lane, Wandsworth, on 3rd August, the daughter of a chemist deceased, aged 14 years, premonitory diarhoea 4 hours, cholera 24 hours – Water from a ditch into which cesspools empty themselves</li>
                  </div>
               <ol>Snow’s research was reinforced by the Reverend Henry Whitehead, who initially doubted Snow’s thesis. But Whitehead found the same Broad Street pump connection by interviewing those locals who hadn’t gotten cholera; these people hadn’t used that pump.</ol>

            The investigation continued. Ultimately, Snow was able to track down <span style="color:blue">197 victims</span>, the vast majority of whom lived within walking distance of the pump. It was also noted that there was an <span style="color:blue">extremely low incidence</span> of cholera at a nearby work house and also at the Lion Brewery, and both of these businesses had their own water supply. The workers at another large business used water from the Broad St. pump, and their workers had a substantial incidence of cholera.

            <section>
               With knowledge of the incubation period for the disease, the shape of an epidemic curve can sometimes provide clues regarding the source of the epidemic. Cholera has an incubation period of only 1-3 days, and this graph indicates that new cases occurred over a period of about 10 days. This suggests a "continuous source" epidemic of cholera exposure because new cases continue to occur for more than one incubation period, suggesting an ongoing source of contamination.

               In retrospect, Snow made several important contributions to the development of epidemiologic thinking.</summary>

            <list>
             <ul> He proposed a new hypothesis for how cholera was transmitted.</ul>
             <ul>He tested this hypothesis systematically by making comparisons between groups of people.</ul>
             <ul>He provided evidence for an association between drinking from the Broad St. well and getting cholera.</ul>
             <ul> He argued for an intervention which prevented additional cases (removal of the pump handle).</ul>
